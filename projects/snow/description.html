<p>This game was made by me and 5 others during a 4 day student game jam. The theme of the jam was alt.ctr, meaning we
	were tasked with creating a game using an alternative/unique control scheme. In our game, you can throw paper
	snowballs 3 home-made targets. You can also physically duck behind cover, which is detected using an ultrasonic
	sensor. The various inputs are sent to Unity through an Arduino and read in-game.</p>
<h1>Tools Used</h1>
<p>We used Unity to create this game, as well as a Makey Makey to easily translate input from the targets into
	keypresses. We also used and Arduino to measure input using an ultrasonic distance sensor, and send that to the
	computer via USB.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>Development over the 4 day period went fairly smoothly. The first day was spent mostly coming up with an idea,
	setting up a git repo, and assigning roles. The idea was fairly simple, and everyone knew exactly what had to be
	done and who was doing it. I was responsible for programming, animation, and partially for sound design.</p>

<p>One major challenge that I faced during development was the signal from the distance sensor. It was very noisy and
	innacurate, making it pretty difficult to tell if someone was ducking or not. This wasn't helped by the fact we
	presented the game in a busy space with lots of people passing by in front of the sensor. I had to smooth out the
	signal and dynamically calibrate what distanced looked like ducking and standing.</p>

<p>We also had some problems with the targets. They were made by hanging two sheets of tinfoil next to eachother so that
	an impact would cause them to touch and complete the circuit. But the current wasn't strong enough to pass through a
	big sheet of tinfoil, and we had to cut it into a mesh to reduce the surface area. This lead to another problem
	where the tinfoil sheets would have trouble touching. We fixed this by creating a small cardboard dome for the
	tinfoil to rest on. Getting the right shape was difficult, but we got there in the end.</p>
