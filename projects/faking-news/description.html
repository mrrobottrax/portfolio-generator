<p>This game was made during a 48 hour game jam. Players connect using peer to peer to make up headlines and pick photos
	in this Jackbox inspired game.</p>

<h1>Tools Used</h1>
<p>Unity as the game engine, and Node JS to create the server used to connect players via lobbies.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>Creating a peer to peer networking solution in 48 hours was a nightmare, and we had to cut a lot of the features we
	originally envisioned such as voice chat and streamed cameras (but it was close!).</p>
<p>A Node JS server keeps track of lobbies and generates room codes. After that, players are connected p2p.</p>
