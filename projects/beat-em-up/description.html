<p>BEAT 'Em Up is a rythym based beat 'em up where the player is rewarded for attacking on beat. This game was the result of a 4 month long first year project that I completed with 4 others.</p>
<p>The game was made in Unity, using the 3D workflow. Voxel assets were created in MagicaVoxel, and a few non-voxel assets were made in Blender. Music was made in FL Studio.</p>
<p>During development, I was responsible for helping to create 3 music tracks for each of the 3 missions, sound effects, creating voxel models, and programming various systems, mainly enemy AI, beat syncronization, improving level design tools / mission system, and bug fixes. All members of our group contributed to the game's design.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, scope creep became a big issue, which only got worse as the workload of our classes increased. This lead to all but 1 of our 3 levels being cut. The music and enemies for these levels were already completed, but we couldn't finish the level design and asset creation in time.</p>
