<p>BEAT 'Em Up is a rythym based beat 'em up where the player is rewarded for attacking on beat. This game was the
	result of a 4 month long first year project that I completed with 4 others.</p>
<h1>Tools Used</h1>
<p>The game was made in Unity, using the 3D workflow but rendered orthographically. Voxel assets were created in
	MagicaVoxel, and a few non-voxel assets were made in Blender. Music was made in FL Studio.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>
<p>The initial plan for our game was to create 3 distinct missions, each themed around a different genre. Another group
	member and I were responsible for creating a song for each of the 3 genres. There were a lot of scrapped songs, but
	by the end of development we had comfortably finished composing, recording, and mixing each track.</p>

<p>I also worked on programming some of the essential systems for the game, including enemy AI, beat syncronization,
	creating level design tools and an objective system, and of course - bug fixes.</p>
<p>Here are some of the assets I made:</p>

<p>Fun fact; I hand drew a pixel art normal map for that crate!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, during the final few weeks, we realized we weren't going to have enough time to finish each area to a
	high standard of quality, so we decided to scrap all but 1 and give it our sole focus.</p>
<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>I definately learned to value of iterative design. My biggest regret with the game is taking so long to develop a
	playable prototype. If we focused on creating a playable version of the game first, rather than creating systems we
	might use later, we could have found issues in our core design right away.</p>
<p>If I were starting over from scratch, I also would have tried to find a more involved use of rythym. We settled on
	the player attacks being delayed to the next beat, but this created a pretty boring gameplay loop of pressing the
	attack button to a steady pulse. It would definately be a design challenge to have more involved rythym without it
	being too much for the player to manage, but it's a challenge I wish we spent more time on.</p>
<h1>Scrapped Content</h1>
<p>We had a lot of cut content throughout development, mostly enemy variants left over from the cut areas.</p>

<p>I'd also like to mention that we had almost finished a really cool squence where the player would be fighting off bad
	guys on a rotating bridge that we had to scrap due to time.</p>
