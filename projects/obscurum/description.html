<p>This game was made by me and 4 others during a 4 day student game jam. I can't remeber exactly what the theme of the
	jam was, something like 'a unique way of interacting with the world'. We chose to make a game very focused on sound
	design, where the player can only see by poking around with a stick. This was inspired by that lidar Gmod addon that
	was popular at the time.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Development time: 4 days</li>
	<li>Group size: 5</li>
	<li>Date: 2022</li>
</ul>

<h1>Tools Used</h1>
<p>If you've looked at some of the other group projects, you might be able to guess that we chose Unity as our game
	engine. I also created the sound effects using Audacity.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>The project came along very quickly, mostly due to it's small scope. I did the programming, sound design, level
	design, and created a couple 3D assets.</p>

<p>The outline effect when poking walls was a challenge. It was my first time programming a shader, and I had to learn
	HLSL in just a few days. There were also a lot of technical challenges with trying to get the effect to only appear
	near where you hit.</p>
